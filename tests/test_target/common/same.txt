In the ARG, Perplex City, there were two "unsolvable" cards, they are the Riemann card, and Billion to One.
The Riemann card is designed to be unsolvable. The solution requires the riemann hypothesis (hence, the Riemann card).
Billion to One was solved in 2021, with facial recognition technology. The card consisted an image of the man, and in Japanese, "Find Me."
